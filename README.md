This project mainly focuses on a lightweight world border design. Although primitive, it is efficient and gets the job done. Players that exceed the world border will get a 5 second warning before being executed if they choose be on the wrong side of the border.

This project was started when I noticed that as my server got larger from players traveling far, the server lagged more and more. I decided to put a limit on it. However, I couldn't find a plugin that did just and only this.

Other features include:

secure players (they have to type in an extra password)

sending items

automatic world saving (this was implemented because of the spam in the console saying the world was saved. I decided to save the world less frequently when no players were online)

# World Borders
This project mainly focuses on a lightweight world border design. Although primitive, it is efficient and gets the job done. Players that exceed the world border will get a 5 second warning before being executed if they are still on the wrong side of the border.

This project was started when I noticed that as my server world size got larger from players traveling far, the server "lagged" more and more. I decided to put a limit on it. However, I couldn't find a plugin that did just and only this.

**Other features include:**

* Secure players (they have to type in an extra password)

* Sending items

* Automatic world saving (this was implemented because of the spam in the server console saying the world was saved. I decided to save the world less frequently when no players were online)
